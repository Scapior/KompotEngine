# KompotEngine

![Build (Ubuntu 20.04)](https://github.com/Scapior/KompotEngine/workflows/Build%20(Ubuntu%2020.04)/badge.svg)


#### What is it?
It is my personal project for C++ practice and learning graphic programming, and also cross-platform development.

#### Why you don't use X for Y?
As I said, the main purpose of this repository is learning, so I want to write everything that doesn't exist in the standard library by myself. For example, an own window class wrapper instead of the GLFW or SDL.

#### Your code have mistake.
I will be glad if you point it to me.

#### What is mean "Kompot" and why did you name the project so?

[[Meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompot)] Just for fun, sometimes my friends call me like that.
